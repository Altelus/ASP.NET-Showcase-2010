Dragon Age Updater
=====================================================================

The Dragon Age Updater is a Windows service and application that is
installed with Dragon Age: Origins. This service is used to check for
game and content updates and to manage those downloads.

The game communicates with the service and the service communicates
with the Dragon Age servers.

If you would like to change the way the Dragon Age Updater service
behaves on your system, you can adjust these options in both the
Dragon Age Updater application and the Dragon Age Configuration
Utility as well as starting and stopping the service. Details on the
various options are provided in those applications.

If you would like the Dragon Age Updater service to run when your
system starts, follow these steps:
- Run "services.msc" from the Run menu option in Windows. Pressing
  the Windows key + "r" will bring this up. (NOTE: services.msc
  controls essential components of Windows. Errors in configuration
  can prevent the system from operating correctly. Any changes you
  make in services.msc are at your own risk.)

  can prevent the system from operating correctly. Any changes you
  make in services.msc are at your own risk.)

Online Features
=====================================================================

BioWare/EA online account
-------------------------
In order to take advantage of the online features of Dragon Age: 
Origins you'll need to create or login to a BioWare/EA online 
account.

You may already have one of these accounts if you've played other EA
games with online features, joined the web community of some EA
games, purchased from the EA Store, or updated your account
information on the Dragon Age website. In other games or EA sites
this is sometimes referred to as your EA Master account, or Nucleus
account.

Screenshots
-----------
As you play Dragon Age: Origins, the game takes screenshots at many
decision points and other special game moments you encounter during
your play-through of Dragon Age:Origins, such as unlocking an
achievement. This provides you with a unique visual progress of
your experience in Dragon Age: Origins. You can also take
screenshots manually at any time by hitting the PrintScreen key.

If you choose to, you can set the game to notify you when it takes a
screenshot, and even to automatically upload key moment screenshots
to your online profile on the Dragon Age community website. Please
refer to 'Online Options' in this readme, or the manual, for how to
enable or disable these options.

Achievements
------------
As you play Dragon Age: Origins, you will unlock achievements.
Achievements provide you with a badge of honor for accomplishing
certain tasks, and in many cases encourage you to try different
skills or explore off the beaten track.

If you are logged in, the game will automatically upload (or
synchronize) your Achievements record with your online profile on the
Dragon Age community website.

You can view your Achievements record in the Achievements window.

Online Profile
--------------
Clicking the 'Online Profile' button in the Player Profile window
will take you to your personal page on the Dragon Age community site,
where you can review your screenshots and character records, and
share them with other community members.

Your Dragon Age community profile includes information on characters
you have created and played Dragon Age: Origins with - their
attributes, stats, paper doll (full body image), avatar (head image),
and Story So Far progress information. In addition, your player
profile includes information on your Achievements record.

Online Options
--------------
To reach the Online Options window from gameplay, press the ESC key,
then the Options item from the menu, and then select the Online tab
in the Options window. 

To reach the Online Options window from the main menu, press the
Options item on the main menu, and then select the Online tab in the
Options window.

On the left hand side of the window are the 'Connection' options.
This includes the option to 'Upload gameplay feedback'. By having
this enabled you are allowing the game to send usability information
to help us improve the game through future patches and updates.

The information sent cannot personally identify you - we collect
aggregate statistical information only - in other words, we may
collect something that says 'one more game load of this area' and
'one more death in this area' which is then ultimately aggregated to
provide us with something like '75% of players are dying in this
area'. But we do not collect a 'you - joe smith - have died in this
area'.

The information collected adheres to EA's privacy policy guidelines,
is identified in the End-User License Agreement before you enter the
game, and is only done for regions/countries where this is permitted
by law.

In all cases, by de-selecting this option (no checkmark) you can opt
out of sending this information. 

We thank all our fans in advance for considering providing us with
this valuable insight and helping us continue to improve Dragon Age:
Origins and our future title - as games get ever more complex (and
especially a massive title like Dragon Age: Origins) this provides us
with real data that we can use for improvement decisions.

On the right hand side of the window are the 'Profile' options. This
includes the option to 'Take achievement and story screenshots',
where at key moments or decision points of Dragon Age: Origins the
game will take a screenshot for your review in the Screenshot
Manager, and if you choose, to share with community members on the
Dragon Age community site.

If you would like to know when screenshots are being taken, you
should select the 'Notify me when screenshots are taken' option. This
will display a small notification in the game when a screenshot is
taken. 

The 'Upload screenshots' option will automatically send key story
screenshots only, to your online profile on the Dragon Age community
site. By default, this option is off. This option only works if you
are logged in, so it is recommended that you also enable the 'always
log me in' option in the Login window.

The 'Upload character profile' option will automatically send
progress information for your game character to your online profile
on the Dragon Age community site - this includes the Story So Far
progress, your character record sheet, your character paper doll
image (full body view), your character avatar image (head view), and
your character stats (such as number of kills, etc).

This option only works if you are logged in, so it is recommended
that you also enable the 'always log me in' option in the Login
window.

Downloadable Content (DLC)
--------------------------
You can view a list of additional content available for download in
several ways. One of these is through the Downloadable Content
window. 

On the 'Available Content' tab, you can see all the content you have
not yet downloaded. It will display the name of the content, the
price (or free), and an icon identifying whether this content was
made by BioWare or other content creators.

Below the list of content you can review your Points Balance. If you
see "--" for your Points Balance this means you are not logged in,
and your Points Balance cannot be verified. Login to your account to
update your Points Balance.

If you are logged in, but your Points Balance is not updating, you
can click the circle arrow besides the "--" - this will force a
refresh of your Points Balance.

To add Points to your account, click the 'Add Points' button. This
will take you to the secure Dragon Age Store website, where you can
purchase Points for your account. Once you have successfully
purchased points, you can close your browser window, return to the
game and click the circle arrow button to refresh your Points
Balance.

The 'Installed Content' tab works similarly to the 'Available
Content' tab (refer to that section of this readme, or the game
manual), but only lists content that is already installed for your
game, and allows you to enable or disable it.

On the left hand side is the content installed for your game. This
includes the title, and whether it is enabled or disabled. You can
toggle whether this content is enabled or disabled for your game by
clicking the checkbox to the right of the title name. On the right
hand side is a description of the content, as well as instructions
for how to access this content in the game. This is also visible in
your game journal.

=====================================================================
Non-North American Keyboards
=====================================================================

If you are playing in English, the keyboard labels referred to in
game apply to North American keyboards. If you have a non-North
American keyboard, the game may refer to some keys differently than
they are labeled. Notably, on a standard UK keyboard, the default
shortcut for the combat tactics screen (the "\" key in North America)
is actually the key labeled "#" just to the left of the Enter key.


=====================================================================
Optimizing Performance
=====================================================================

We recommend you close all running programs before launching Dragon
Age: Origins.

Always make sure you have the latest video drivers from your video
card manufacturer.

If you experience performance issues while playing the game, try
changing the following settings one by one until performance
improves. These settings can be found under the Video section of the
configuration utility or the Video section of the in-game Options
menu:

- Lower the resolution: the game will run the fastest at 800x600
- Lower the Graphics Detail: Lower settings offer less graphics
  detail and lower quality shadows, but will run faster
- Anti-Aliasing: Disable this for best performance
- Texture Detail: Lower texture detail will help if your system
  does not have a lot of system or video memory. Only select high
  texture detail if you have a video card with at least 512 MB
  of video memory
- Frame-Buffer Effects: Disabling framebuffer effects will 
  significantly improve performance on certain older video cards
- VSync: For best performance, leave this to disabled. Only enable
  it if you notice excessive tearing artifacts

Especially if your video card has 128MB of video RAM, or your system 
has 1 GB of memory, we highly recommend you select "Low" for both the 
graphics detail and the texture detail options.

If you have an nVidia series 7 video card and notice significantly
lower performance in fullscreen mode, try enabling the "Disable
Multiple Render Targets" video option on the configuration utility.
This option should stay disabled in all other cases.

Note that if your graphics card does not support the Shader Model 3
model, all graphic detail levels other than "Low" will be
unavailable.

Aspect-ratio correction:
For the best graphics quality it is recommended that you run the game
in the native resolution of your monitor. If you select a lower
resolution and the image appears to be distorted, either compressed
horizontally or vertically, try checking the "Disable Aspect Ratio
Correction" option in the Dragon Age: Origins Config program.

If you experience long loading times or hitches during gameplay, we
recommend you defragment your hard drive. You can find information on
how to defragment your hard drive by searching for "disk
defragmenter" on the Windows Help and Support center.
